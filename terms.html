Indemnification.</strong> You agree to indemnify, and hold Gakko, its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with (a) your access to or use of the Platform; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right or any publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; or (d) any claim that your use of the Platform caused damage to a third party.</p> <p><strong>8. Limitation of Liability.</strong> YOU AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL GAKKO BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, USE, IMAGES, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLES, EVEN IF GAKKO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL GAKKO BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE LESSER OF $50 AND THE FEES RECEIVED BY GAKKO FROM YOU IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES DURING THE THREE (3) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY HEREUNDER.</p> <p><strong>9. General.</strong></p> <p><strong>9.1 Modification.</strong> Gakko may modify these Terms at any time. Modifications become effective immediately upon your first access to or use of the Platform after the “Last Revised” date at the bottom of these Terms. Your continued access to or use of the Platform after the modifications have become effective will be deemed your conclusive acceptance of the modified Terms. If you do not agree with the modifications, do not access or use the Platform.</p> <p><strong>9.2 Applicable Law</strong> These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may require the application of the law of another jurisdiction. </p> <p><strong>9.3 Dispute Resolution</strong></p> <p>&emsp;<strong>(a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of the Platform that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed, all arbitration proceedings will be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Gakko, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</p> <p>&emsp;<strong>(b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong> Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (<strong>“Notice”</strong>) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Gakko should be sent to: 243 Canal Street, New York, NY 10013. After the Notice is received, you and Gakko may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Gakko do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</p> <p>&emsp;<strong>(c) Arbitration Rules.</strong> Arbitration shall be initiated through the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (<strong>“JAMS”</strong>), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (<strong>“ADR Provider”</strong>) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at http://www.jamsadr.com/. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p> <p>&emsp;<strong>(d) Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</strong> If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p> <p>&emsp;<strong>(e) Time Limits.</strong> If you or Gakko pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the JAMS Rules for the pertinent claim.</p> <p>&emsp;<strong>(f) Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Gakko, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the JAMS Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Gakko.</p> <p>&emsp;<strong>(g) Waver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Gakko in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND GAKKO WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p> <p>&emsp;<strong>(h) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. </p> <p>&emsp;<strong>(i) Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p> <p>&emsp;<strong>(j) Severability.</strong> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p> <p>&emsp;<strong>(k) Right to Waive.</strong> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p> <p>&emsp;<strong>(l) Survival of Agreement.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Gakko. </p> <p>&emsp;<strong>(m) Small Claims Court.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Gakko may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p> <p>&emsp;<strong>(n) Emergency Equitable Relief.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.
